                MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME

                Mentoring is a unique method of supporting students to improve their learning and leadership skills, motivating them towards their future career development. With this in mind, the college has a mentorship programme wherein the faculty members are given training on mentor system and meet the students on day-to-day basis to listen to their issues and guide them on their overall personality development.

                THE STUDENT MENTORSHIP PROGRAMME (SMP)
                The Student Mentor Programme (SMP) is a programme within the RCL student community, under the guidance of the principal and faculty coordinators with the following primary objectives of enabling constructive interaction, guidance and mentorship of junior students by senior students. Providing, a reliable and comprehensive support system, to motivate students to excel in both academic and non-academic fields and to make the most of their life at the college. The objectives of the SMP include:

                To help the first year students understand the challenges and opportunities present in the college and develop a smooth transition to campus life.
                To counsel academically weak undergraduate first year students and to play an important role in helping troubled students cope with academic, extra-academic and personal problems.
                To provide positive role models to first year undergraduate students in the college.
                To proactively try to identify problems of the general student populace and to bring them to the notice of the concerned authorities
                The SMP endeavors to pursue these objectives by carefully identifying those who can act as an anchor and guide for a freshman or an academically weak student. Student Mentors will be selected to play this role and are given the authority to pursue the mission of this programme. Student Mentors usually belonging to the Final year of B.A., LL.B. Each of them would be assigned a group of first year students. Each Student Mentor reports directly to the Faculty Advisor. He/she would be the direct point of interaction with the first year students and may report special cases for the consideration of Faculty Advisor. This two way system is devised to help freshman to be at ease with new environment of the college. This is explained schematically below:

                Principal
                Faculty Advisor (FA)
                Student Mentor (SM)
                ESSENTIAL QUALITIES OF A STUDENT MENTOR (SM)
                The qualities mentioned below are guidelines used by the Faculty Advisors in selecting the new Mentor team.

                A Student Mentor is normally a student from the Final year of B.A., LL.B
                Empathy and humility are the most essential qualities for any mentor to possess. It is necessary for a mentor to empathize with the wide variety of situations his mentees could face and be humble enough not to impose their own opinions but to tailor advice to the mentee's needs.
                Ethics are of paramount importance for ISMs and they should be able to instill the same in their mentees.
                SMs should be academically inclined and capable of persuading others to be the same.
                Preferably those students who are already working with the other committees of the college should not be considered.
                SMs should be someone as a role model people can look up to, because of their achievements and personality.
                The Student Mentor body is vested with the following powers

                Every Students mentor has the power to halt any activity that involves freshmen. Such activities include, but are not limited to: introduction sessions conducted by seniors, either personal or relating to extracurricular activities, which extend beyond acceptable limits of time or decency etc. Senior/Junior Prefect are advised to keep the SMs informed about any activities involving freshmen.
                In matters pertaining to academics, which require preventive or curative action to be taken in the interest of the wards, the mentor has the responsibility and the right to bring the case to notice of the concerned. Faculty Advisor, who would in turn take the necessary action.
                In matters that affect the wards, and can only be resolved at the college level, the Student Mentors have the right to bring the problem to the notice of the principal, it is however desired that the mentor team works in harmony with the disciplinary committee and various other committees of the institution.
                In case of fresher who needs additional help, Students Mentors shall coordinate with Faculty Advisor.
                ROLE OF THE FACULTY ADVISOR (FA)

                The FAs play a very important role in selecting the team of Student Mentors. Selecting a team of responsible, sensitive and dedicated mentors is very critical to the success of the SMP.
                The FAs oversee the day-to-day functioning of the SMP. For this, they must keep in regular touch with the SMs and freshmen to ensure that the primary objective of the programme is being fulfilled.
                The SMs are expected to give regular updates regarding the functioning of the SMP to the principal.
                In particular, if a SM feels that a particular freshman is facing academic/emotional problems that cannot be handled by him/her, the SM must report the matter to the Principal immediately.
                The FAs must ensure accountability from all SMs to the extent possible. As such, they may recommend suspension or removal of SMs from the team for dereliction of duty/non-performance to the SMP body.
                The SMP body should interact and share their experiences once in a month to the principal.
                FA shall counsel the students with difficulty in adjusting to the environment.
                FA shall also, advice students to take help of their Student Mentors (SM)
                ROLE OF THE STUDENT MENTOR (SM)   Each Student Mentor is assigned a group of 6-10 freshmen, who would henceforth become his/her mentees. Under normal circumstances, it is the primary duty of the SM to guide the group of students assigned to him/her through their first year in the college. However, the responsibility of each mentor extends to the entire first year batch and hence, the Mentor should feel free to intervene in any matter related to freshmen.

                The Mentor should ensure to the best of his/her ability that the freshmen (especially his/her mentees) are able to adjust comfortably to life at RCL- both in the college and in the hostel.
                For this, it is imperative that the Mentor establishes a close rapport with his mentees.
                The Mentor should see to it that he/she meets them at certain critical junctures of the first year such as the first few weeks of the semester, well before semester exams and at the time of results.
                The Mentor must act on any complaint of misbehavior by a senior. The institute has strict policies against ragging of any form.
                The Mentor has to impress upon his/her mentee the need to maintain a balance between academic and extra-curricular activities, so that one utilizes one's time at college in the most productive manner.
                The Mentor must ensure that no activity is forced upon any freshman against his/her will. The thin line between forcing and persuasion is one which the Mentor has to judge based upon his/her perception of the freshman, and the matter at hand.
                The Mentor should be ready to help his/her mentee overcome any problems (academic or social) in an advisory role and act as a responsible role model. At the same time, he must realize the importance of making his/her mentee independent and self-reliant.
                Mentors should immediately inform the FA or the Student Counselor regarding any potentially serious case related to their mentees or any other student (if they come to know of it).
                Mentors are expected to play their role as responsible seniors using their own discretion.
                Duties of Mentors

                Mentors are required to keep track of their mentees with reference to academics, attendance, discipline and overall development
                Mentors are to record their findings in the mentorâ€™s diary.
                Any complaint or compliments regarding mentees are to be brought to the notice of the respective mentors.
                Mentors, if required are to schedule face to face counseling with their mentees.
