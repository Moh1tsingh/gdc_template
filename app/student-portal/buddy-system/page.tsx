            The GDCH Buddy System program is an initiative to help connect GDCH students who would like to meet friends or establish new connections (whether you're taking in-person or virtual classes). We know college can be a big adjustment - whether you're transitioning from high school, transferring from another college, currently a GDCH student or coming back to college after some time away - the Buddy System connects you with another GDCH student!
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify pt-4">
            The Buddy System accepts new Buddies at the start of the Fall and Spring semesters. Participants in the program will receive some free GDCH give-a-ways, invitations to exclusive Buddy System events, and will receive weekly discussion topics to help facilitate conversation with your buddy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify pt-4">
            You can carry on buddy system correspondence via email or move to another preferred mode of communication. This is a great opportunity to make new friends, learn more about how other students on campus are doing, and establish more connections on campus.
